Hi everyone, I'm Andrew. I'm a software engineer at Lyft.

## Generation 1: Monolith

- Python/Angular monolith
- Everything is in one codebase
- Conventions can be enforced
- Code is reviewed in one place

???

But problems

---


## Generation 2: React Service Template

- Node + React isomorphic (SSR) apps
- Lyft really started to embrace microservices = service explosion

---

## But the problems were starting to catch up to us

- x
- y
- z
???

- Architecture drift
- Entropy
- Natural systems decay

### Technical leverage

<img width="80%" src="./images/leverage.png" />

???

This is a talk about leverage, and how to think about it and knowing where to apply it. When building a system that scales, you have to find the right points in the system where you can exert technical leverage

#### Technical Leverage: Applying Outsized Force

- Developer productivity
- System reliability
- Security

## But where to start?

???

But where in the system do you apply?

It can be hard to know where to start. Itâ€™s worse to build the wrong abstraction than have no abstraction at all.

We selectively apply leverage at different tiers of the system

At the bottom library/infra layer: control (manage with tooling)

## Principles for Technical Leverage

| <h1>ðŸ‘Ÿ</h1> | <h1>âœ¨</h1> | <h1>ðŸ¤–</h1> |
| -- | -- | -- |
| **Stand** on the Shoulders of<br />Giants | **Simplify** to Understand | **Standardize** and **Automate** |

???

Let's go through these one by one

---

## Stand on the Shoulders<br />of Giants ðŸ‘Ÿ

We chose **Next.js** as our platform of choice

--

**Solved**: Build configurations, static site generation, AMP pages, code splitting, dynamic imports

???

We chose Next.js because the community was moving faster than we were
Prior to this we were managing our own Webpack-based build system and we couldnâ€™t keep up, and we were burning a lot of developer hours managing it
Additionally Next.js solved many more problems that we anticipated having to solve ourselves:
SSG, AMP pages, code splitting, dynamic imports
Things that were already being solved piecemeal elsewhere in the org, but werenâ€™t being centralized back into the platform
What if we could stand on the shoulders of the community, participating as we went along?

--

<span class="emoji-large">ðŸŽ·</span> **Now:** We don't need to maintain our internal build system anymore

---

## Simplify to Understand âœ¨

**Paradigm shift**: convention over configuration

???

Previously, every application was a snowflake, configured in its own special way.

--

**Next.js**: Filesystem router, server-side `getInitialProps` and `getServerSideProps` handlers

--

<span class="emoji-large">ðŸŽ·</span> **Now:** Decreased support burden on platform teams, higher reusability

???

Next.js wasnâ€™t just about picking a community-run project, but it represented a paradigm shift for applications
We bought into the convention-over-configuration philosophy which simplified the mental model of building apps at Lyft
Filesystem router
Server-side data fetching
Folder conventions
This lowered the cognitive load of working across Lyft FE services, making developers more productive across services.


---

## Standardize and Automate ðŸ¤–

We built a **plugin** system that standardizes our library integrations

--

We made **migrations** a first-class part of our new system

--

<span class="emoji-large">ðŸŽ¸</span> **Now:** we have the tools to keep the stack modern and prevent drift

---

## Anatomy of a Plugin

- A set of hooks, bundled up in a library

???

A @lyft/service Plugin:

- Allows you to integrate libraries by providing hooks at specific layers of the system: React (Server + Client), Express middleware, Next initialization

- Allows you to integration libraries by providing hooks at specific layers of the system: React (Server + Client), Express middleware, Next.js initialization

- Export user-functionality like hooks that are then used by the consumer.

```typescript
// CookieAuthPlugin: Express.js server hook
import cookieParser from 'cookie-parser';
import { Application } from 'express';

const cookieAuthServerHook = (app: Application) => {
  // Gives us req.cookies
  app.use(cookieParser); 

  app.use(function parseUserId(req, res, next) {
    // Assume this decrypts data and returns a user ID from a session
    const { userId } = parseSessionCookies(req.cookies)

    // Store userId in response for later retrieval
    res.locals.userId = userId
    next();
  });
};
```

---

class: background-color-code small-code

```typescript
// Create a context to hold the user ID
CookieAuthContext = React.createContext();
```

---

class: background-color-code small-code

```typescript
// CookieAuthPlugin: Next.js App hook
function CookieAuthApp({ App: NextApp }) {
  return class extends App {
    static getInitialProps = async (appContext) => {
      const originalProps = await App.getInitialProps(appContext);
      const userId = appContext.ctx.res?.locals?.userId;

      return { ...originalProps, userId };
    };

    render() {
      return (
        <CookieAuthContext.Provider value={this.props.userId}>
          {super.render()}
        </CookieAuthContext.Provider>
      );
    }
  };
}
```


---

class: background-color-code small-code

```ts
// Bring it all together into the Plugin
export default class CookieAuthPlugin {
    apply = (service: ServicePluginHost) => {
        service.hooks.server.tap(this.name, cookieAuthServerHook);
        service.hooks.app.tap(this.name, (App) => CookieAuthApp({ App }));
    };
}
```
---

class: background-color-code small-code

```ts
// And add a nice developer-facing convenience hook
const useCookieAuth = () => ({
  userId: React.useContext(CookieAuthContext),
  isLoggedIn: () => {
      const userId = React.useContext(CookieAuthContext);
      return !!userId
  },
});
```

---

class: background-color-code small-code

```tsx
// Developer experience as follows...
import { useCookieAuth } from '@lyft/service-plugin-cookie-auth';

// In React component
const Page: React.FC = () => {
    const { user_id, isLoggedIn } = useCookieAuth();
    // That's it! You can now use as you see fit
    if (!isLoggedIn()) {
      return (<p>Sorry, you must be logged in</p>);
    }
};
```

---

## Next.js

- Lean on OSS community to build/maintain the core infrastructure
- Filesystem router lets us ditch a lot of boilerplate code
- SSR support out of the box
- We really liked the community

---

## Design philosophy: Selective Control

In order to guide us into our next phase of growth, we needed to standardize and automate the parts of the ecosystem that were starting to drift

---

## Benefits we saw from our plugins

- Benefit: Consistent interfaces - standardization
- Benefit: Remove outliers
- Benefit: Flywheel effect - contributors within the community

---

## Migrations

Migrations are guardrails that prevent drift
Migrations increase user satisfaction and developer ergonomics
All plugins ship with the ability to run jscodeshift migrations, and because implementations have been standardized, can be knowingly applied
Migrations run sequentially

We also have a tool that can selectively apply and merge jscodeshifts

---

## Organizational process

- Hands-on migration workshops
- Tools that automate away 90% of the migration from Gen 2 to Gen 3
- Trainings for teams to help each other
- Relentless internal evangelism

---

## Core principles and takeaways

1. Don't overoptimize. Make sure you have a true pain point before you attempt a migration to your next phase
2. Apply selective leverage (control) at appropriate points in the system.
3. Allow escape hatches; there will always be outliers
4. Make sure you finish the job
